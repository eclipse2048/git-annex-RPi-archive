git-annex-RPi-archive
=====================

An archive of git-annex binaries for the Raspberry Pi

This repository is an archive of all [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) versions I compiled for the Raspberry Pi and other ARM hard float CPUs. If you're just interested in the latest binary, use the repository [git-annex-RPi](https://github.com/tradloff/git-annex-RPi) instead.

Note that all git-annex versions in this archive were compiled without the webapp and without webDAV. 

Install dependencies:

    apt-get install libgsasl7
